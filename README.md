Moving contents from a tumblr blog to another. 

My blog was suddenly disconnected from my user account: it was still there to be read, but it didn't show up in my dashboard: the list of blogs was empty! After a useless exchange with the official help system ("We take security very seriously") and after some fiddling around, I decided to use the API to move the contents from my blog into a new one I created in my dashboard. The trickiest part was to understand how to use the API's authorisation scheme, but official documentation is quite clear. Hope this helps someone else.
